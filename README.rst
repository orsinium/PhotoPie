In the scientific community and important element is the 'References' or stepping on the shoulders of giants. 
Nobody goes deep into the documentation and starts writing thousands of lines of code nowdays. 
That's why I am more than grateful, learning every day how to make my code better. Some blogs I got inspiration from:
